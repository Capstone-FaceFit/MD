## About
### 🔥 Wrap Up
We are a Mobile Development team, who created "FaceFit", an application built on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, leveraging Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This application helps users determine suitable glasses based on face shape. The application provides suggestions for suitable places to purchase glasses by providing a purchase link from a website. The standout feature of FaceFit is its machine learning function that identifies human facial features with 98,7% accuracy. This innovative feature, supported by a cloud deployment model from our Cloud Computing team, simplifies the user experience. All sales data is stored securely via APIs developed by our Cloud Computing team, ensuring smooth operations and making FaceFit a leader in bridging technology and sustainability.
